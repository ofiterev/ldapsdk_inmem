/**
 * This package contains a number of helper classes for interacting with monitor
 * entries ing Ping Identity, UnboundID, and Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent 8661 server
 * products.  It provides methods for parsing the monitor entries as specific
 * subtypes and for extracting the information that they provide in useful ways.
 * <BR>
 * <BLOCKQUOTE>
 *   <B>NOTE:</B>  The classes within this package, and elsewhere within the
 *   {@code com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.unboundidds} package structure, are only
 *   supported for use against Ping Identity, UnboundID, and
 *   Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent 8661 server products.  These classes provide support
 *   for proprietary functionality or for external specifications that are not
 *   considered stable or mature enough to be guaranteed to work in an
 *   interoperable way with other types of LDAP servers.
 * </BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <BR>
 * The {@code MonitorManager} class provides a number of utility methods for
 * retrieving server monitor entries from a Ping Identity/UnboundID Directory
 * Server.  The {@code MonitorEntry} class and its subclasses provide access to
 * the data in those monitor entries.
